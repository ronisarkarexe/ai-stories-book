<a id="prerequisites"></a>

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local development environment
- Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your local development environment

### How to Install Git

Git is a version control system that is used to manage the source code of your project.

To install Git, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Git from the [Official Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Open the terminal or command prompt on your local development environment
3. Verify the installation of Git by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

### How to Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript, essential for managing dependencies in Node.js projects. Here's how to install Node.js and npm:

1. **Download Node.js:**

   - Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stable releases or the latest version for cutting-edge features.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

2. **Verify Node.js Installation:**

   - After the installation is complete, open your terminal or command prompt.
   - To verify that Node.js has been installed successfully, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```
     node -v
     ```

   - This command should display the version of Node.js installed on your system. If it does, Node.js installation was successful.

3. **Verify npm Installation:**

   - npm comes bundled with Node.js, so once Node.js is installed, npm is automatically installed as well.
   - To confirm that npm is installed, in your terminal or command prompt, type:

     ```
     npm -v
     ```

   - Press Enter. This command should display the version of npm installed on your system. If it does, npm installation was successful.

4. **Optional: Update npm (recommended):**

   - It's recommended to keep npm up to date to access the latest features and bug fixes.
   - To update npm to the latest version, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```
     npm install -g npm@latest
     ```

   - This command will update npm to the latest stable version globally (-g flag).

By following these steps, you have successfully installed Node.js and npm on your system. You are now ready to start building JavaScript applications and managing dependencies with npm.

### Steps to Setup Project

1. **Fork the repository:** To create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account, click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the project repository page.
2. **Clone the forked repository:** To clone the repository to your local development environment, open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/story-spark-ai.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:** To install the necessary dependencies for the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a new branch:** To create a new branch for your project, run the following command:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-project
    ```
5. **Add your changed files:** Add changed files to the stage by running the following command:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
6. **Commit your changes:** To save your changes to the branch,, run the following command:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "add: <your-name>"
    ```
7. **Push to the branch:** To push the changes to the remote repository, run the following command:
    ```bash
    git push origin add-project
    ```
8. **Create a pull request:** To submit your changes to the main repository, create a pull request by clicking on the "Compare & pull request" button on your forked repository page.
9. **Wait for review and merge:** Wait for the project maintainers to review and merge your changes.
